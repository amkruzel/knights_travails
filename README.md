## Knights Travails
This program will find the shortest path for a knight â™ž to take to get from one square to another on a chess board. It is meant as practice with algorithms and data structures.

## Usage
You can see the program run on replit.com [here](https://replit.com/@amkruzel/knights_travails). There is no user input, but you can edit the 'knights_travails.rb' file to try it out.

- add `knight_moves([x1, y1], [x2, y2])` to the end of the file
- `[x1, y1]` are the starting coordinates, `[x2, y2]` are ending coordinates
- coordinates can go from `[0, 0]` to `[7, 7]`, with `[0, 0]` being the bottom-left square of the board, and `[7, 7]` being the top-right square
- the program assumes that the coordinates given are 'legal' squares
